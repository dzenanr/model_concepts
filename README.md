**Categories**: design tool, graphical models, canvas, local storage, json.

**Internal name**: Magic Boxes

##Description 
A graphical design tool for domain models of 
[dartling] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling).
Spirals can be found in the [mb_spirals] (https://github.com/dzenanr/mb_spirals) 
project.
The last spiral is a graphical model designer.
The json representation of a model is generated in Model Concepts. 
This representation is used in the 
[dartling_gen] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling_gen) project to 
generate code for a model supported by the
[dartling] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling) domain model framework.
